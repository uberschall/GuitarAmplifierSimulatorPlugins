# GuitarAmplifierSimulatorPlugins

Currently plugin development is being done at bitbucket privately.

I have my own blog to release those plugins at https://tonebrewer.wordpress.com/tag/1959slp/

- Marshall 1959 SLP model has been released to the public.
- Other amplifier models under the test are:
 * Marshall JCM800 2203 model
 * Orange Tiny Terror
 * Orange Dark Terror
 * Peavey 6505+
 * MesaBoogie LoneStar
 * MesaBoogie Mark IIc+
 * MesaBoogie Mark V
 * MesaBoogie Dual Rectifier 3 channel model
 * MesaBoogie Triaxis
 * CAE3+ Preamplifier
 * ENGL Fireball
 * Bogner Uberschall
 * Dumble ODS-100

I need a GUI designer who designes plugin panel, knobs, and buttons. If you're interested in audio plugin development, please contact me (audvans@gmail.com).
